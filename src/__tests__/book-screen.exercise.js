// Render the Application with AppProviders ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Let's get started by making this an async test. I know that this will be async, and pretty much all integration
// tests will be. The first thing that we want to do is render our app. Let's import the app from that App Module
// that we've got.

// If we're going to want to create an app element, we'll need to import react from 'react' to create React elements,
// and we'll import render from '@testing-library/react.' We'll also want to interact with the screen. We'll do
// screen here, then we'll render the app, and we'll say screen.debug.

// Now, we've got a full-page spinner. We're rendering the app, and it's attempting to load the user's information.
// We've got some act warnings that we can deal with later. Let's go ahead and stop here and review what we've done
// so far.

// First, we're rendering the entire application. That's what an integration test is. In particular, we're going to
// be just rendering the book screen, but we want to render everything, including our router, and our query provider
// for a react-query, and our own authentication provider.

// We're going to render the app itself and then make sure we can land on the book screen to test that specific
// book screen. This is to get us going. We're rendering our app in the same way that we're rendering it in
// production. By doing this, we are well on our way to writing an integration test for the booking screen.

// Wait for Loading Element to Be Removed //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Now we want to wait for this full-page spinner to go
// away, and it's got a label of loading for screen readers. We can query it by that, and wait for that to go away.
// There's a utility for that, waitForElementToBeRemoved. Right here we'll await waitForElementToBeRemoved, we'll say screen
// getByLabelText(/loading/i)).

// This is a quick one. All we did was import waitForElementToBeRemoved, then we added a callback in here and
// waitForElementToBeRemoved.

// We'll call this callback every time there's a DOM change
// or on a regular interval, and it will prevent our test from running any further until that element no longer
// returns.

// Reverse-engineer AuthProvide and Log In //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We're not on the right screen right now. We should be logged in rather than showing the log in and register.
// We need to trick our application in the thinking that we're logged in.

// In review, what we did here was we reverse engineered our AuthProvider and found that they stick some fake token
// in localStorage.

// They even expose that localStorage key as part of the providers' exports. We're able to trick the authentication
// provider into thinking that the user is logged in by setting that localStorage key to some fake token.

// Then to make sure that we handle the request that's made when our user lands on the page in the first place and
// they're logged in, we override window.fetch to handle when the fetch request is to anything at /bootstrap and we
// return a successful response. Here we say, "OK, true," and JSON is this async function that returns some data.

// If we dive into our API client, then that is exactly what we need. We need to have a response with a JSON
// function that's async, so we can await it and then respond, "OK, needs to be true," so it returns that data.

// With all of that setup, now we're in the locked inside of the application.

// Render a Book Page in a Test ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Before we render our app, let's navigate to that page so when our app is rendered, we're already at the right
// spot. We're going to say window.history pushState, but the first argument is the state. We don't really care about
// that.

// In review, we did a couple of things here. First, we wanted to get our test on the route that the user's going to
// land on for the bookScreen. We used window.history.pushState to get us on the right page. We also generated a book
// and we used that books id.

// Then through this process, we noticed that our API Mark here was not complete. Even though our test was passing,
// the code wasn't functioning the way that it actually would in production. We needed to fix our API Mark a little
// bit to send that token along with the bootstrap request.

// Then with all this set up, our code started to make a request to the books endpoint for the book that we
// landed on. We had to add an additional handler here, and we simply returned the book information that our backend
// would return if we hit our backend at that url.

// Doing all of that made it so that when we called screen.debug, we see that we are on the book page and we see
// all of the book's information.

// Test What UI Elements are Present /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Now that we've successfully rendered our book to the screen, let's make sure that all the book's information is
// on the screen, and we have the right buttons in place for adding this to our list.

// Let's review this whole thing really quick. The first thing that we did was we rendered our entire application.
// We noticed that there was a problem with our provider not being rendered, so we added a wrapper option with the
// app providers. When we did that, we noticed that we're just rendering the loading screen.

// We added waitForElementToBeRemoved, so that we waited until that loading spinner disappeared. Then we noticed we
// started making some network requests. We mocked fetch to handle those network requests. We wanted to make sure we
// landed on the book page.

// We built a book and routed ourselves to that book's page. We also made sure that we are tricking our authProvider
// into thinking we're actually logged in. Again, this will differ based on the authProvider that you use. Some of
// them you might actually have to mock the entire module itself.

// Once we got all of that set up finished, we were able to make some assertions on what should appear on the
// screen, as well as what should not. This gives us a huge amount of confidence in the screen page itself and all
// of the providers and everything else that's doing work to get our users to that screen page.

// Yes, it may be quite a bit of work to get to this point, but it is 100 percent worth it for all of the confidence
// that we get from this test.

// Isolate Tests by Cleaning up State and Cache ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// There's one other thing that I want to share before moving on. That is we always want to make sure we clean
// things up. As we render through all of this stuff, we're going to be loading the query cache with a bunch of
// information, and we'll want to clear that out.

// I'm going to add an afterEach() for our cleanup. This is going to be an async function, because we want to
// await auth.logout.

// Create Mock msw Server (Extra) /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We should probably take this window.fetch mark and move it somewhere more and more general, so it can be used
// for all of our integration tests.

// Let's review what we did here. We had a window.fetch mock right here that we just wanted to get rid of,
// because it wasn't giving us enough confidence. We swapped it out for the test server that we already had
// configured for a previous test that we setup.

// That was configured to have all of these server handlers that were already written, so we can handle every
// request that our application makes. These server handlers interact with a database and get our test setup
// before we actually render our app, we interact with that database ourselves.

// Then we also want to make sure that we're in a good non-loading state before we continue with the rest of our
// tests. We enhanced our wait for element to be removed to make sure we're no longer in the loading state, and
// then we also cleaned up after each one of our tests.
