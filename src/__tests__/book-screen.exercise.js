// Render the Application with AppProviders ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Let's get started by making this an async test. I know that this will be async, and pretty much all integration 
// tests will be. The first thing that we want to do is render our app. Let's import the app from that App Module 
// that we've got.

// If we're going to want to create an app element, we'll need to import react from 'react' to create React elements, 
// and we'll import render from '@testing-library/react.' We'll also want to interact with the screen. We'll do 
// screen here, then we'll render the app, and we'll say screen.debug.

// Now, we've got a full-page spinner. We're rendering the app, and it's attempting to load the user's information. 
// We've got some act warnings that we can deal with later. Let's go ahead and stop here and review what we've done 
// so far.

// First, we're rendering the entire application. That's what an integration test is. In particular, we're going to 
// be just rendering the book screen, but we want to render everything, including our router, and our query provider 
// for a react-query, and our own authentication provider.

// We're going to render the app itself and then make sure we can land on the book screen to test that specific 
// book screen. This is to get us going. We're rendering our app in the same way that we're rendering it in 
// production. By doing this, we are well on our way to writing an integration test for the booking screen.

// Wait for Loading Element to Be Removed //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Now we want to wait for this full-page spinner to go 
// away, and it's got a label of loading for screen readers. We can query it by that, and wait for that to go away. 
// There's a utility for that, waitForElementToBeRemoved. Right here we'll await waitForElementToBeRemoved, we'll say screen getByLabelText(/loading/i)).

// This is a quick one. All we did was import waitForElementToBeRemoved, then we added a callback in here and waitForElementToBeRemoved.

// We'll call this callback every time there's a DOM change 
// or on a regular interval, and it will prevent our test from running any further until that element no longer returns.
