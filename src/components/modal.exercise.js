// Create Compound Components for a Flexible Modal /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Let's start out by making the API that we want to have exist and then we'll go ahead and build that API. What we 
// want to be able to do is have a modal component, and inside of that modal component we want to have a control for 
// the openButton. We'll have a modalOpenButton.

// Let's review how we made this abstraction. Here, we made a modalContext. That's how we implicitly share some 
// state between all of these modal components. The modal is responsible for rendering that contextProvider and 
// providing that value to all of the models compound components.

// Those children components consume that context and grab the piece of that contextValue that they need to do their 
// job. The dismissButton and openButton have an API that accepts a single child and makes a copy of that child 
// setting the onClick prop to update that isOpenState that is implicitly shared from the modal component.

// Then our modal contents component is the one that's responsible for rendering the reach-ui-dialog. It forwards 
// along the isOpenState. It also handles the onDismiss callback to update the state that's been implicitly shared.
