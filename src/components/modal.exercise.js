// Create Compound Components for a Flexible Modal /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Let's start out by making the API that we want to have exist and then we'll go ahead and build that API. What we
// want to be able to do is have a modal component, and inside of that modal component we want to have a control for
// the openButton. We'll have a modalOpenButton.

// Let's review how we made this abstraction. Here, we made a modalContext. That's how we implicitly share some
// state between all of these modal components. The modal is responsible for rendering that contextProvider and
// providing that value to all of the models compound components.

// Those children components consume that context and grab the piece of that contextValue that they need to do their
// job. The dismissButton and openButton have an API that accepts a single child and makes a copy of that child
// setting the onClick prop to update that isOpenState that is implicitly shared from the modal component.

// Then our modal contents component is the one that's responsible for rendering the reach-ui-dialog. It forwards
// along the isOpenState. It also handles the onDismiss callback to update the state that's been implicitly shared.

// Add callAll (Extra) /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We've got a small problem with the way our modal-dismiss-button and modal-open-button work. I can demonstrate that
// by adding an onClick handler to our button for opening the log in modal.

// In review, what we did here is make this little abstraction here -- that is, a function that accepts any number of
// functions, and it returns a function that accepts any number of arguments. Then when that's called for each of the
// functions that were passed, if that function does exist, then we'll call that function with all of the arguments
// this function was called with.

// If this bit is a little bit confusing, that's OK. You can rewrite this yourself into something that makes a little
// bit more sense, or you could just inline it like we were doing here if you find that to be slightly simpler.

// If you do end up running into this problem a lot, having a nice abstraction like this is really handy, and that's
// something I learned firsthand when I was building downshift.


// Create ModalContentsBase (Extra) /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// As cool as it is that we can create this circle Dismiss button JSX and reuse that React element in both of these 
// places, most of the modals in our application are going to have this X circle over here for closing that modal.

// It makes a lot of sense to have that built into our modalContents component. However, there may be some situations, 
// where we don't want to have a close button, and I wouldn't want to have a special prop here that says, "No close 
// button." That would be weird.

// Let me show you what I'm going to do instead. Right here, I'm going to rename modalContents to modalContentsBase. 
// Then, I'm going to make another component called modalContents. This will take all these props. It will return the 
// modalContentsBase and forth along all those props.

// In review, what we did here is we took this modalContents component and renamed it to modalContentsBase. Then we 
// took what was common between both of those login forms, copied that over here, and then accepted the differences 
// as props.

// We can use this modalContents and it will come along with the circle Dismiss button automatically as well as the 
// title. Then, it can render whatever it is that this particular modal needs to render as the children.

// This composition can go as deep as you need it to. You can have different types of modalContents based on the type 
// of modal that you want to create. The world is your oyster with this composition. Whenever you see yourself 
// creating the same kind of modal, then you can create an additional component that encapsulates that type of modal.

// It all ends up working perfectly because of the way that we're implicitly sharing the state between these 
// components.
